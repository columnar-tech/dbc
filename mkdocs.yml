        dbc simplifies the installation and management of Apache Arrow Database
        Connectivity (ADBC) drivers across multiple platforms including macOS,
        Linux, and Windows. It supports installing pre-built drivers with a
        single command, managing multiple drivers without conflicts, and creating
        reproducible environments with driver list files. dbc works great in
        CI/CD environments and can be installed via pip, Docker, Homebrew, and more.
