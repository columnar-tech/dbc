# Driver List

The term "driver list" refers to the `dbc.toml` file managed by dbc. A driver list file is ideal for checking into version control alongside your project.

See the [Driver List](../guides/driver_list.md) guide to learn how to use a driver list file.
See [dbc.toml](../reference/dbc.toml.md) for information about the format of the file.
