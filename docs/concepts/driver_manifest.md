# Driver Manifest

The term "driver manifest" refers to an [ADBC Driver Manfifest](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/format/driver_manifests.html).

In short, a driver manfiest is a metadata file that stores key information about a driver, including the information a [Driver Manager](./driver_manager.md) needs to load it.

For example, here's an example driver manifest for the MySQL ADBC driver:

```toml
manifest_version = 1
name = 'ADBC Driver Foundry Driver for MySQL'
publisher = 'ADBC Drivers Contributors'
license = 'Apache-2.0'
version = '0.1.0'
source = 'dbc'

[ADBC]
version = '1.1.0'

[Driver]
[Driver.shared]
macos_arm64 = '/Users/user/Library/Application Support/ADBC/Drivers/mysql_macos_arm64_v0.1.0'
```

Many details about how driver manifests work are outlined in the [ADBC Driver Manifests](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/format/driver_manifests.html) documentation.
