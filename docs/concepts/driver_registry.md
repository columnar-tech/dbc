# Driver Registry

dbc installs drivers from a "driver registry" which is an internet-accessible index of installable [ADBC driver](./driver.md) packages.

By default, dbc is configured to communicate with Columnar's public and private driver registries. Most drivers will be from the public registry but some will be marked with a `[private]` label which means they're from the private registry. See [Private Drivers](../guides/private_drivers.md) for information on how to install and use private drivers.

When you run a command like [`dbc search`](../reference/cli.md#search) or [`dbc install`](../reference/cli.md#install), dbc gets information about the drivers that are available from each configured registry by downloading its `index.yaml` or using a cached copy.
