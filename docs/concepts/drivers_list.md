# Drivers List

The term "drivers list" refers to the `dbc.toml` file managed by dbc. The drivers list file is ideal for checking into version control alongside your project. See the [Drivers List](../guides/drivers_list.md) guide for more information.

TODO: Verify this once bugs features are added and bugs are fixed (https://github.com/columnar-tech/dbc/issues/36)

```toml
[drivers]
mysql
duckdb = "1.3.2"
```
