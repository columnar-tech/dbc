# Installing Drivers

We want a longer-form guide for the basic workflows related to installing drivers.

Outline:

1. Install a single driver (pick one), show where it goes, what it installs
2. Show installing with version constraints
3. Show how installing can be updating (i.e., install x==1.0.0, install x>1.0.0)
4. Cover behavior driven by environment variables (`ADBC_DRIVER_PATH`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`, `CONDA_PREFIX`)
5. Show how `--level` works
6. Cover uninstalling?
