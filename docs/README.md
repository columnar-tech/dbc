# dbc docs

dbc uses [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for docs.
Building the docs requires a Python installation.

## Setup

From the root of the repository, run:

```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

## Building

To build the docs website, run,

```sh
mkdocs build
```

The built docs website will be in `./site` and you can preview it by running this (or something similar):

```sh
python -m http.server -d site
```

## Developing

mkdocs has live preview+reload. To use it while developing, run:

```sh
mkdocs serve
```
