# Supported Platforms

dbc is supported on the following platforms:

- macOS (Apple Silicon)
- macOS (Intel)
- Linux (x86_64)
- Linux (aarch64)
- Windows (x86_64)

dbc is developed, tested, and packaged for these platforms. If you find any problems or would like to request your platform be included, please file an [Issue](https://github.com/columnar-tech/dbc/issues).

## Driver Support

Drivers that you can install with dbc are generally available for all of the above platforms.
When dbc [installs](../guides/installing.md) a driver, it tries to find a driver matching the platform it's being run on and will return an error if one isn't found.

For example, on arm64 Windows you would get this error:

```console
$ dbc install sqlite
Error: no package found for platform 'windows_arm64'
```
